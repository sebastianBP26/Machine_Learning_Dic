In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date.  The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).  "
